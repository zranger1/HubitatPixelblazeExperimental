# hubitatpixelblazedriver (Experimental branch)
Experimental/Test version of the Hubitat Elevation device handler for the Pixelblaze addressable LED controller.

**NOTE:** At any given moment, this version may not be complete, and it may have features
and **BUGS** not present in the main branch. I highly recommend using the main
version in https://github.com/zranger1/hubitatpixelblazedriver
unless you have a specific reason for trying this one. It **probably** won't set
anything on fire!
