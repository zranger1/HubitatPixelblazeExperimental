# hubitatpixelblazedriver (Experimental branch)
Hubitat Elevation device handler for the Pixelblaze addressable LED controller.

This version may have features and BUGS not present in the main branch. I highly
recommend using the main version in https://github.com/zranger1/hubitatpixelblazedriver
unless you have a specific reason for trying this one. It **probably** won't set
anything on fire!

Test Donut Button!
